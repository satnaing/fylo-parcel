## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

I've learned Sass before doing this project, but never tried once on a project before. In this project, I applied what I learned about Sass (variables, partials, mixins etc). I used Scss syntax in this project.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Doc](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - Where I learned most about Sass and its features.
- [Sass File Structure](https://itnext.io/structuring-your-sass-projects-c8d41fa55ed4#:~:text=Simple%20Structure&text=scss%20.,buttons%2C%20navbars%2C%20cards%20etc.) - A good article about structuring Sass projects.
